This project is based entirely from the work done by Johnathan Chiu (https://github.com/johnathanchiu/boosted-project). Additionally, Robert Scullin's project beambreak (https://beambreak.org/) was a massive help in getting the correct encoding pattern for the throttle control.

To build this project, you will need an esp-32 microcontroller as well as an ESP-IDF development environment. More info can be found in Johnathan Chiu's boosted-project repo. 


The project is covered under the MIT license, so anybody can modify or utilize this code however they see fit :)
